This SQL-based data analysis project focused on optimizing sales for a shop by leveraging insights from four key tables: "User," "Gold Signup," "Products," and "Sales." 
Through the implementation of various SQL queries, the project aimed to extract valuable information and draw actionable insights. 
The queries explored user behavior, identified patterns in gold signups, analyzed product performance, and assessed sales trends.
The resulting findings were compiled into a comprehensive PowerPoint presentation (PPT), where each query's insights were elaborated upon. 
The presentation highlights strategic recommendations and actionable steps based on the data analysis, ultimately providing a roadmap for boosting sales and improving overall business performance. 
This project showcases the power of SQL in uncovering meaningful patterns and driving informed decision-making in the realm of e-commerce.
